# Project Setup Complete

## What Has Been Created

This repository now has a fully functional Java project structure for implementing parallel LLP (Las Vegas + Learning) algorithms. Here's what has been set up:

### Key Components

1. **Problem Interface** (`Problem<T>`): Generic interface that any problem must implement
   - `getInitialState()`: Starting state
   - `isGoal()`: Check if solution found
   - `getSuccessors()`: Generate next possible states
   - `evaluate()`: Score/fitness function
   - `formatSolution()`: Display results

2. **LLPAlgorithm** (`LLPAlgorithm<T>`): The parallel execution engine
   - Configurable number of threads
   - Configurable max iterations
   - Automatic best solution selection

3. **LLPResult** (`LLPResult<T>`): Contains solution and metadata
   - Solution state
   - Score/fitness
   - Iterations taken
   - Thread ID that found solution

### How to Use

1. **Implement a new problem:**
   ```java
   public class MyProblem implements Problem<MyStateType> {
       // Implement required methods
   }
   ```

2. **Solve the problem:**
   ```java
   LLPAlgorithm<MyStateType> algorithm = new LLPAlgorithm<>(
       problem, numberOfThreads, maxIterations
   );
   LLPResult<MyStateType> result = algorithm.solve();
   ```

3. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   # or
   mvn clean package
   java -jar target/llp-algorithms-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
   ```

### What You Can Build On

The framework is ready for implementing various problems such as:
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Graph Coloring
- Knapsack Problem
- N-Queens Problem
- Scheduling Problems
- Path Finding
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems
- And many more optimization problems

### Next Steps

1. Create new problem classes in `src/main/java/com/llp/problems/`
2. Implement the `Problem<T>` interface
3. Add your problem to `Main.java` or create a new entry point
4. Write tests in `src/test/java/com/llp/problems/`
5. Run and verify your solution

### Build System

- Java 11+ required
- Maven 3.6+ required
- JUnit 5 for testing
- All dependencies managed via Maven

### Testing

```bash
mvn test                    # Run all tests
mvn clean package          # Build with tests
```

### Security

- No known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- CodeQL analysis passed with 0 alerts
- Safe for development and educational use

## Ready to Build!

The project is now fully initialized and ready for development. All core infrastructure is in place, tested, and documented. You can start implementing your LLP algorithm problems immediately!
